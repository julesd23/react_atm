# React_atm

## Description
This is an exercise that keeps track of how much money you withdrawal and deposit using state in React. I added some functionality to display an error when one tries to withdrawal more money than is in the account itself. Using state this error is also taken away once the amount submitted is reduced to something that is within the amount of the account. I took away all page items that were hard coded onto the html file and put them into either a JSX or CSS file to keep things clean. I then added some minimal styling.
